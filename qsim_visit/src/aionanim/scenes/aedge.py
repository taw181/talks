"""AEDGE: the same instrument in space, on both of the talk's plots at once.

The gravitational-wave landscape (the detectors of SensitivityBuildUp, without
the merger tracks) and the ultralight dark-matter photon coupling (the
insets' panel, drawn full size) side by side, each as the talk has already
shown it: LIGO, LISA, ET and AION's three stages on the one, AION's stages
against today's limits on the other. Then AEDGE goes onto both in one step.
A baseline of ~4e7 m between two satellites moves the gravitational-wave
reach down in frequency, between LISA and the ground, and the dark-matter
reach down in mass, where the ground stages do not go at all.

    uv run manim -ql src/aionanim/scenes/aedge.py AEDGESensitivity

The one pause, before AEDGE arrives, goes through beat().
