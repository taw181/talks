# --- a light shift injected into one interferometer -----------------------
# How a gradiometer is tested without waiting for a wave. Between the first
# pi/2 and the pi pulse an off-resonant beam is turned on across the upper
# cloud alone. It is far enough from resonance to drive nothing -- no atom
# changes state, no momentum is handed over, the geometry is untouched -- but
# while it is on it shifts the clock levels, and with them omega_A.
#
# Only one arm picks the shift up, and not because only one arm is lit: the
# beam covers the whole cloud. A hand turns at omega_A only while its arm is
# in |e>, so the arm that has been excited since the beamsplitter accumulates
# the shift and its partner, sitting in |g>, does not. The two hands stop
# agreeing, and that disagreement is the phase.
#
# The lower interferometer never sees the beam and stays on its null, so the
# shift does not cancel in Phi_upper - Phi_lower. That is the whole point: it
# arrives in the difference exactly the way a dark-matter or gravitational-wave
# signal would, which is what makes it a test of whether one would be caught.
# The same figure as GradiometerGW's, with the source on a shutter.
LS_ON, LS_OFF = 0.3, 0.72  # the stretch of the first leg the beam is on for
LS_PAD = 0.38  # how far its band stands off the interferometer it covers
# What the shift is tuned to inject. A third of a turn is chosen to be read
# rather than to be realistic: big enough to see on a dial and to split the
# upper ports plainly (P_g = 1/4), against a lower interferometer that still
# sends everything into |g>.
#
# Negative because delta_LS is signed and a beam below resonance pushes the
# levels together -- and because the sector on the dial is then the angle
# itself rather than the rest of the turn. phase_sweep wraps into one turn and
# sweeps from one hand to the other, so a hand that has run ahead by a third
# of a turn is drawn as two thirds of one. Nothing about the measurement
# changes with the sign: the ports split by cos(Phi) either way.
LS_PHASE = -TAU / 3

# --- the readout: two imaging pulses --------------------------------------
# The ports are read by fluorescence on the 461 nm line, one state at a time:
# a pulse images the atoms in 1S0 (|g>, "S") and blows them away, then the
# atoms in 3P0 (|e>, "P") are repumped and imaged with a second one. One
# camera frame takes both clouds, so each pulse is vertical -- simultaneous
# at the two clouds -- unlike the interferometer's pulses, which climb the
# baseline. Times are where they cross the diagram: late enough that the
# upper cloud's two ports are an atom apart when S is imaged, early enough
# that the P ports stop short of the right-hand side, which the readout image
# takes over.
