"""A gravitational wave passing through the gradiometer.

GradiometerGW and GradiometerGWStretch are the same figure with a wave passing
through, drawn the two ways people draw one. GradiometerGW modulates the light
travel time and leaves the freely falling atoms on the worldlines they already
had, which is where the signal actually comes from; GradiometerGWStretch bows
the worldlines so the baseline visibly breathes, which is the picture most
people carry. The same h(t) runs along the top of both, they take their pulse
timing from the same place, and so their dials read the same phase.

The *Continuous variants run the whole diagram on one lab clock (see
aionanim.tools.spacetime); RunsContinuously is the mixin that does it, and the
light-shift scenes reuse it.

    Only the pulse-and-leg sequence differs between a stop-start scene and a
    continuous one, and it differs the same way for both pictures of the wave.
    So it is written once here and mixed in ahead of whichever scene it is
    running, which is what lets the stretched baseline have a continuous
    variant for free. Everything it needs -- the vertices, where each cloud is
    when a pulse crosses it, how its worldlines bow -- it asks the scene for.

    What the mixin buys these scenes in particular: the one quantity a
    gradiometer figure exists to show -- that the far cloud is split, mirrored
    and recombined L/c after the near one -- is a statement about *when*
    things happen to each of them. Stopping the atoms to draw a pulse makes it
    unshowable, so the stop-start scenes say it in words: a caption reading
    "arrives late" beside a dashed ghost. Here the pulse climbs while the
    atoms fly, the near cloud splits, and the far cloud is still a single seed
    for L/c afterwards. The caption becomes a label on something the frame is
    doing.

    The price is that the pulses are quick. Run at V a crest pulse crosses the
    frame in under a second and the trough pulse, whose light travel time the
    wave has very nearly closed up, in a tenth of one -- which is not a defect
    but the measurement: the two are drawn at the ratio the wave put between
    them rather than dilated to the same length and annotated.
