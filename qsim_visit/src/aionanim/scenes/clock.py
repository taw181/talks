"""The clock interferometer's phase, read out as the angle between two hands.

ClockPhase introduces the readout the other scenes lean on. The clock is the
interferometer, not either arm: each arm carries a hand that turns only while
that arm is excited, but what the last pulse reads out is the angle between
the two hands, and a symmetric interferometer comes back to zero. The
gradiometer then compares two such clocks at opposite ends of the baseline
through one laser, and the wave changes the light travel time between them.
The readout is written as what it is made of, Phi = Phi_propagation +
Phi_laser: the symmetric clock zeroes the first term, and the phase the pulses
write in leaves the second on the dial.
ClockPhaseTerms is the same scene with that budget marked up, naming the laser
term the gradiometer exists to cancel.
