"""An ultralight dark-matter field read out by a clock interferometer.

DarkMatterPhase is ClockPhase with that null broken. An oscillating ultralight
scalar field modulates the fundamental constants, and with them the Sr clock
frequency: omega_A -> omega_A [1 + eps cos(omega_phi t + theta)]. The mirror
hands the excitation from one arm to the other halfway through, so the two
arms integrate omega_A over different stretches of the oscillation, the hands
come back to different angles and the two output ports split. Same instrument
as the gravitational-wave scenes, pointed at a different source.

DarkMatterField comes before either: the field on its own as a scrolling
trace, and the clock transition it walks up and down, with no interferometer
yet. Its pauses go through hold(), one whole oscillation, so a slide can loop
them without a jump.
