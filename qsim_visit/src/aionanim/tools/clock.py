# --- phase, drawn as a clock hand -----------------------------------------
# The clock is the whole interferometer, not either arm on its own. The
# oscillator is the Sr clock transition at omega_A, and the pulses start and
# stop a Ramsey comparison against it -- that is what makes this an atom
# *clock* interferometer.
#
# A single arm is not a clock. Between pulses each arm is in a definite
# internal state, one in |e> and the other in |g>, swapped at the mirror, and
# an energy eigenstate does not tick: its phase e^{-iEt/hbar} only means
# something relative to another state. A hand that turns "only in |e>" is
# bookkeeping with E_g set to zero, showing the phase of |e> relative to |g>.
# What is measured is omega_A times the *difference* in the two arms' time
# spent excited, and that quantity belongs to both arms together.
#
# The hands are still exactly the lab-frame phase, which is why the drawing
# works. Each pulse writes omega_L * t_emission, fixed by when the laser
# fired rather than when the pulse arrived, so with equally spaced pulses the
# laser terms cancel between the arms; on resonance what is left is
# omega_A * [(t2'-t1') - (t3'-t2')] in arrival times. Two arms that have
# spent equal time up there land their hands on top of each other -- the null
# a gradiometer sits on, and what a gravitational wave breaks by moving those
# arrival times.
