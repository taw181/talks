# --- the clock transition, drawn as a two-level system --------------------
# What makes AION a *single-photon* interferometer is that the transition it
# drives is narrow: in strontium the 1S0 -> 3P0 clock line at 698 nm has a
# natural linewidth of order millihertz, so an atom parked in |e> stays there
# for the whole interrogation time. Elsewhere a pair of Raman photons is
# needed to leave the atom in a long-lived ground-state sublevel; here one
# photon does the work, and the laser's phase is written into the atom once
# per pulse instead of twice.
#
# The diagram sits upper left and doubles as the figure's key: |g> carries
# ATOM_COLOR and |e> carries KICKED_COLOR, which are the colours the two arms
# are drawn in, so it says everything a separate legend would and also says
# what the pulses are resonant with. Upper left is the one corner it can sit
# in -- the mirror's emitted photons climb the column x = MZ_B[0] and out of
# the top of the frame, and the title already occupies the right.
