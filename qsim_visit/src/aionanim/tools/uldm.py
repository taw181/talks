# --- an oscillating ultralight dark-matter field --------------------------
# A scalar field light enough to be a coherent wave in the lab oscillates at
# omega_phi = m_phi c^2 / hbar. Coupled to the fundamental constants it drags
# them along with it, and the Sr clock frequency goes with them:
#
#     omega_A -> omega_A [1 + eps cos(omega_phi t + theta)].
#
# That is not a shift the interferometer can throw away. An arm only winds its
# hand while it is excited, and the two arms are excited over different
# windows -- arm 1 over leg 1, and the mirror hands the excitation to arm 2
# for leg 2 -- so each integrates its own stretch of the oscillation. Equal
# window lengths no longer mean equal phase, the hands miss each other and the
# ports split. It is ClockPhase's null broken by the source rather than by the
# geometry.
#
# Deliberately off resonance. omega_phi = pi / T would put the three pulses on
# zero crossings with each leg exactly a half-cycle, which reads as if the
# measurement only worked when the field was tuned to the sequence. Here the
# sequence is 1.2 periods long and starts at an arbitrary phase, and the two
# windows still integrate to different amounts -- the response goes as
# sin^2(omega_phi T / 2), which is only zero at omega_phi T = 2 pi m.
