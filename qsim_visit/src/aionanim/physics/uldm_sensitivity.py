"""AION's reach for ultralight scalar dark matter coupled to photons, as numbers.

The curves of Badurina et al., JCAP 05 (2020) 011 (arXiv:1911.11755), Fig. 3
middle panel -- the photon coupling |d_e| each scenario reaches at SNR 1 in
1e8 s, against the scalar's mass m_phi -- and the lower edge of the region
already excluded, read off the PDF's vector paths into
aionanim/data/uldm_sensitivity/ by data_scripts/digitise_uldm_sensitivity.py.

Masses are in eV; a field of mass m oscillates at f = m c^2 / h.
