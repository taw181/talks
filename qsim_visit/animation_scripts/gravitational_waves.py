"""Gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger.

A flat sheet of spacetime, drawn as a wireframe grid, is dented by two black
holes and rippled by the radiation they emit. As the pair spirals in, both the
frequency and the amplitude of the ripples climb, until the holes merge and the
sheet rings down to a single well.

The field is evaluated at retarded time, so at any instant the rim of the sheet
is still showing the slow, weak waves emitted seconds earlier while the centre
shows the fast, strong ones -- that contrast across the sheet *is* the chirp.

MergerOnSensitivityPlot puts the same merger beside LIGO's sensitivity curve,
with a dot riding the source's characteristic-strain track in step with the
sheet. The track is real (a 60 Msun binary at z = 0.1, from gw_signals.py);
the dot's timing is not -- ten years of inspiral are squeezed into the
sheet's fourteen seconds, with a readout saying how long is really left.

Everything visual comes from style.py.
